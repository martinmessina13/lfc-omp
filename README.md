# Low Frequency Constrained Orthogonal Matching Pursuit

Algorithm to restore aliasing-free clipped signals (e.g. those coming from a recording studio). The solution arises in terms of a successive approximation method based on the sparse signals framework. Signal restitution in the presented approach is possible due to the clipping threshold estimation's by means of the Fej√©r's averaging method. This procedure, coined Low Frequency Constrained Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (LFC-OMP), is a variation of the traditional algorithm Constrained Orthogonal Matching Pursuit or C-OMP to the use case of the aliasing-free clipped signals.

omp.py contains the code for the algorithm, with comments explaining each line.

The results state a positive linear correlation between both algorithms after studying the metrics $\Delta  \text{SDR}_c$, $\text{SDR}_c$, $\text{PEAQ ODG}$ y $R_\text{nonlin}$ obtained from restoring aliasing-free clipped signals with LFC-OMP and digitally clipped signals with C-OMP. Also, the absolute differences between each of these metrics are insignicant. These results imply that LFC-OMP can be used to restore clipped aliasing-free signals, in the same way that C-OMP is used to restore signals which were clipped in the digital domain.
